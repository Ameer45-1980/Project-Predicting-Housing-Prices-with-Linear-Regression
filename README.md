# Project Overview: Predicting Housing Prices with Linear Regression
### Problem Statement
In this project, I am conducting a project to predict housing prices in various U.S. regions. Housing prices are influenced by numerous factors, and my goal is to develop a reliable model to estimate prices based on key features of each property. This Project will be useful for real estate stakeholders interested in data-driven pricing strategies and insights into the housing market. Given the structure of the data and the nature of the problem, I chose Linear Regression as an initial approach due to its ability to model relationships between features and target outcomes effectively.
#### Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
1. Build an interpretable model for predicting housing prices based on relevant housing and area features.
2. Identify key predictors of housing prices, offering insights into how various features impact price estimation.
#### Choice of Data and Justification

The dataset, USA_Housing.csv, provides structured information on housing prices across regions in the United States, containing the following columns:
1. Avg. Area Income: Average income of residents in the property’s city.
2. Avg. Area House Age: Average age of houses in the same city.
3. Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Average number of rooms for houses in the same city.
4. Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Average number of bedrooms in the same city.
5. Area Population: Population of the city.
6. Price: Actual selling price of the house (target variable).
7. Address: House address, which will be excluded as it is irrelevant for price prediction.
8. 
I chose this dataset because it includes features that are closely associated with housing prices, allowing for a focused analysis. 
#### Choice of Model and Justification

Linear Regression was selected as the baseline model for several reasons:
1. Interpretability: Linear models allow for straightforward interpretation, which is essential for understanding the influence of each       feature on the predicted price.
2. Baseline Comparison: As a starting point, Linear Regression helps establish a baseline for prediction accuracy. Depending on results,      more complex models may be explored if this baseline falls short.
   In case of non-linear relationships, I am open to testing Polynomial Regression as an extension,  if needed to handle feature        relationships and reduce potential overfitting.
#### Data Quality and Structure

The dataset appears to contain well-structured, numeric features conducive to regression analysis. Key considerations for quality assurance include:
1. Missing Values: Checking for any nulls in the dataset, as they could affect the model’s performance.
2. Outliers: Identifying outliers in key features such as price and area income, which could skew predictions.
3. Distribution and Correlations: Examining data distributions and correlations between features to ensure suitability for linear modeling.
#### Libraries and Tools for Data Exploration and Preparation

To carry out these steps, I will use the following Python libraries:
1. Pandas: For data manipulation and basic exploration, such as handling missing values and calculating summary statistics.
2. NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizations to explore data distributions, detect outliers, and assess correlations.
4. scikit-learn: For modeling, including Linear Regression and potential alternative models.

#### Project Goals and Expected Outcomes

The end goal is to develop a predictive model that provides reliable estimates for housing prices, based on the identified features. Through this project, I aim to:
1. Improve predictive accuracy for housing prices, using data-driven insights.
2. Understand feature importance, offering actionable insights for real estate analysis.
